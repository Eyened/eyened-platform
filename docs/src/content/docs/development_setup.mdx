description: Set up your development environment for the Eyened platform
---

This guide will help you set up your development environment for contributing to the Eyened platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.8 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick Start

To start the development environment:

```bash
cd dev
docker-compose up -d
```
To start a database and fileserver 

And in separate terminals:
```bash
./start_client_dev.sh
./start_server_dev.sh
```

Now you can make edits to the client or server code, the application should update automatically.

:::tip
Check the README in the `dev` folder for  more details.

:::note
If this is your first time running the development environment, you may need to:


1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git
    cd eyened-platform
    ```

2. Install server dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

4. Install client dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

5. Make the start scripts executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_client_dev.sh start_server_dev.sh
    ```

:::caution
The browser updates automatically when editing code, but sometimes the webgl context is outdated and you may need to refresh the page manually.
:::

:::caution
The FastAPI server doesn't always restart automatically after code edits. You may need to manually restart the server in some cases.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. Make your changes and test them locally

3. Push to the public repository and create a pull request

:::caution
Never commit sensitive information like API keys or passwords to the repository. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
