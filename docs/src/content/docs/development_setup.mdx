description: Set up your development environment for the Eyened platform
---

This guide will help you set up your development environment for contributing to the Eyened platform. The platform consists of several components that can be developed independently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.8 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Repository Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git
    cd eyened-platform
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. Install dependencies for the backend:

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

:::note
The above step creates a virtual environment (venv) that you'll need to reference in the Development Environment Configuration section.

## Development Environment Configuration

1. Ensure a database is running (documentation to be added)

2. Create a `.env` file in the dev directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../dev
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

    Configure the environment variables in `dev/.env` according to your setup.

## Running Development Processes

From the `dev` directory:

1. Start the nginx fileserver:
    ```bash
    docker-compose build  # First time only
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. Start the client:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_client_dev.sh  # First time only
    ./start_client_dev.sh
    ```

3. Start the server:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_server_dev.sh  # First time only
    ./start_server_dev.sh
    ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. Make your changes and test them locally

3. Push to the public repository and create a pull request

:::caution
Never commit sensitive information like API keys or passwords to the repository. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
