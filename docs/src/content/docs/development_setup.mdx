description: Set up your development environment for the Eyened platform
---

This guide will help you set up your development environment for contributing to the Eyened platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.8 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git
    cd eyened-platform
    ```

2. Start the development environment:

    ```bash
    cd dev
    docker-compose up -d
    ./start_client_dev.sh
    ./start_server_dev.sh
    ```

Now you can make edits to the client or server code, they should update automatically in the browser.

:::note
If this is your first time running the development environment, you may need to:

1. Create a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

2. Run `docker-compose build` before `docker-compose up -d`

3. Make the start scripts executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_client_dev.sh start_server_dev.sh
    ```

4. Install client dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

5. Install server dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../server
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

:::caution
The FastAPI server doesn't always restart automatically after code edits (likely due to in-memory session management). You may need to manually restart the server in some cases.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. Make your changes and test them locally

3. Push to the public repository and create a pull request

:::caution
Never commit sensitive information like API keys or passwords to the repository. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
