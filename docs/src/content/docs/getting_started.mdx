## Getting started with the Eyened Platform

The Eyened Platform consists of three main containers:

- **Eyened database** The core of the platform, holds image and annotation metadata organized in a hierarchical structure Patient -> Study -> Series -> ImageInstance. It can be generated and accessed via the `eyened_orm`.

- **Eyened API** A fastapi API providing an interface to the database.

- **Eyened viewer client** A browser application for image visualization and annotation.
