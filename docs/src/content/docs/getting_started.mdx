description: Deploy the Eyened platform in a network
---


The Eyened platform is a modern web platform for visualization and annotation of ophthalmic images with features like:

- Loading of various image formats including DICOM.
- Convenient system for browsing loaded studies and images.
- Task system for managing grading tasks.
- Drawing tools for 2D image segmentation of enface images and OCT B-scans
- Images and annotations are rendered in the browser, making it very responsive and easy to set up.
- Image enhancements such as CLAHE can be applied on the fly.
- Integrated tools for registration of enface images.
- Automated ETDRS grid placement via AI-based bounds detection and landmark detection (fovea, optic disc) upon insertion of CFI images.
- Python-based import script for loading images and associated metadata.
- Authentication system can secure the viewer, images, thumbnails and annotations.
- For advanced use cases, our ORM allows data scientists to more easily work with the database.

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to get started with the eyened platform is by configuring and running our docker-compose on a server accessible within your network (admin privileges are necessary). Our containers will create a setup like the following:

![Alt text](../../assets/eyened_platform.png)

With this setup you will be able to:

- Run the client / viewer, initially on an empty database.
- Run our import script to import local images and associated metadata into the system. Access to the images through the Eyened platform will be protected by authentication.
- A sqlite database will be created for the app's data in the local filesystem.
- Annotations and image thumbnails will be stored in local folders by the Eyened server.

:::caution
Make sure to set up regular back ups for both the sqlite database and storage folders.

### Setup

1. Clone our repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git eyened_platform
    ```

2. A docker-compose project can be found in `eyened_platform/docker`:
    

    Create a copy of `sample.env` and configure the variables used by docker-compose to set up the containers by editing `.env` with your favorite text editor:

    ```
    cd eyened_platform/docker
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

    The following environment variables are available:

    | Variable | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | HOSTNAME | Hostname the app will be served on |
    | PORT | Port the app will be served on |
    | JWT_SECRET_KEY | Secret key used to encode/decode access tokens and for password hashing. Change to something random when setting up the system |
    | PUBLIC_AUTH_TOKEN_DURATION | Duration of user access tokens in seconds (default: 3 days) |
    | ADMIN_USERNAME | Username for the default admin user |
    | ADMIN_PASSWORD | Password for the default admin user |
    | IMAGES_BASEPATH | Local folder to serve images from (may be read-only) |
    | STORAGE_BASEPATH | Local path to store annotations, thumbnails and other generated files |
    | DATABASE_PATH | Path to the database files |
    | DATABASE_PORT | Port to access the database from outside (optional) |
    | DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD | Root password for external database access (optional) |


3. Build and run the containers:

    ```
    docker-compose build
    USERID=$(id -u) GROUPID=$(id -g) docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```

4. Now the viewer should be available at `http://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>` from within the network. Make sure to verify this.

5. To import data, follow the [Importer guide](importer).
