description: Deploy the Eyened platform
---

The Eyened platform is a modern web platform for visualization and annotation of ophthalmic images with features like:

- Loading of various image formats including DICOM.
- Convenient system for browsing / filtering loaded studies and images.
- Task system for managing grading tasks.
- Drawing tools for 2D image segmentation of enface images and OCT B-scans
- Images and annotations are rendered in the browser, making it very responsive and easy to set up.
- Authentication system secures the viewer, images, thumbnails and annotations.
- Image enhancements such as CLAHE can be applied on the fly.
- Integrated tools for registration of enface images.
- Automated ETDRS grid placement via AI-based bounds detection and landmark detection (fovea, optic disc) upon insertion of CFI images.

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to get started with the eyened platform is by configuring and running our docker-compose. The platform will then be accessible from any machine within your network. 

With this setup you will be able to:
- Run the client / viewer, initially on an empty database.
- Run our import script to import local images and associated metadata into the system. 

You can set up the Eyened platform in two ways:

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

We provide a setup script that automates the installation process and includes enhanced security features:
Prerequisite: ensure docker and docker-compose is installed

1. Clone our repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git 
    ```

2. Run the setup script:

    ```bash
    cd eyened-platform/docker
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

The setup script will:
- Prompt you for configuration settings or use defaults
- Create and configure the `.env` file
- Create necessary directories for images, storage, and database
- Build and start the containers
- Display the URLs for accessing the platform

:::note
**Running Multiple Instances:** If you want to run multiple instances of the platform on the same host:
- Change the name in docker-compose.yaml to something unique for every project
- Change the port of adminer in docker-compose.yaml (or remove this service) to avoid conflicts
- Assign different folders for storage for each instance
- Assign different ports to expose mysql docker
:::

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Clone our repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the docker directory:

    ```bash
    cd eyened-platform/docker
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

    | Variable | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | PORT | Port the app will be served on |
    | ADMIN_USERNAME | Username for the default admin user |
    | ADMIN_PASSWORD | Password for the default admin user |
    | IMAGES_BASEPATH | Local folder to serve images from (may be read-only) |
    | STORAGE_BASEPATH | Local path to store annotations, thumbnails and other generated files |
    | DATABASE_PATH | Path to the database files |
    | DATABASE_PORT | Port to access the database from outside |
    | DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD | Root password for external database access |
    | DATABASE_USER | Username for database access |
    | DATABASE_PASSWORD | Password for database access |

4. Create the necessary directories:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p $HOME/eyened-platform/{images,storage,database}
    ```

5. Start the platform:

    ```bash
    USERID=$(id -u) GROUPID=$(id -g) docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Accessing the Platform

Once the platform is running:

1. The viewer will be available at `http://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>` from within your network
2. Adminer (database management) will be available at `http://<HOSTNAME>:8080`

To manage the platform:

- To view logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- To stop the platform: `docker-compose down`
- To start the platform: `USERID=$(id -u) GROUPID=$(id -g) docker-compose up -d`

:::caution
Make sure to set up regular back ups for both the MySQL database and storage folders.

:::tip
**Using eyened_orm python package**

The eyened_orm python package can be installed by running:
```bash
pip install orm
```

To use the eyened_orm package for database access, copy the `.env` file from the docker folder to the eyened_orm/environments folder:

```bash
cp docker/.env orm/eyened_orm/environments
```

**Multiple Database Environments**

You can create different environment files to connect to different databases or use different database users. For example, to set up a read-only database user:

1. Copy the existing environment file:
```bash
cp orm/eyened_orm/environments/.env orm/eyened_orm/environments/read-only.env
```

2. Update the database credentials in `read-only.env`:
```bash
DB_USER=readonly_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

3. Use the environment in your code:
```python
from eyened_orm import DBManager
DBManager.init("read-only")  # Will automatically read from 'eyened_orm/environments/read-only.env'
```

## Next Steps
To import data into the platform, follow the [Importer guide](/eyened-platform/importer).

For more details about the platform's architecture and services, see the [Platform Design](/eyened-platform/platform_design) documentation.
