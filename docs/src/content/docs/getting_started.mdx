description: Deploy the Eyened platform in a network
---


The Eyened platform is a modern web platform for visualization and annotation of ophthalmic images with features like:

- Loading of various image formats including DICOM.
- Convenient system for browsing loaded studies and images.
- Task system for managing grading tasks.
- Drawing tools for 2D image segmentation of enface images and OCT B-scans
- Images and annotations are rendered in the browser, making it very responsive and easy to set up.
- Image enhancements such as CLAHE can be applied on the fly.
- Integrated tools for registration of enface images.
- Automated ETDRS grid placement via AI-based bounds detection and landmark detection (fovea, optic disc) upon insertion of CFI images.
- Python-based import script for loading images and associated metadata.
- Authentication system can secure the viewer, images, thumbnails and annotations.
- For advanced use cases, our ORM allows data scientists to more easily work with the database.

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to get started with the eyened platform is by configuring and running our docker-compose on a server accessible within your network (admin privileges are necessary). Our containers will create a setup like the following:

With this setup you will be able to:

- Run the client / viewer, initially on an empty database.
- Run our import script to import local images and associated metadata into the system. Access to the images through the Eyened platform will be protected by authentication.
- A sqlite database will be created for the app's data in the local filesystem.
- Annotations and image thumbnails will be stored in local folders by the Eyened server.

:::caution
Make sure to set up regular back ups for both the sqlite database and the annotation folders.
