description: Conventions and database migration setup for Eyened ORM
---

{/* Claude query: In cli.mdx, document the command line utilities in cli.py. Include a section for each utility and explain what they do. ie. that full will create a full copy of the production database for development reasons and update thumbnails will update all thumbnails in the database. Do not include the specific options for each command as these might change, but do indicate that they can be checked with --help */}

This document is meant for developers of the Eyened database and ORM. It explains how to develop changes and how to create and test database migrations.

## ORM conventions
- We use [Annotated Declarative Syntax](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/declarative_tables.html#using-annotated-declarative-table-type-annotated-forms-for-mapped-column) to specify columns. This has the advantages that the resulting ORM objects have type annotations and everything is very readable. This means:
    - every column should have a `Mapped` type declaration, eg `MyColumn: Mapped[int]`. 
    - use `Optional` to create a nullable column, eg `MyColumn: Mapped[Optional[int]]`
    - use `mapped_column()` on the right hand side if necessary. `mapped_column()` derives the datatype and nullability from the Mapped annotation. mapped_column() is not necessary if there are no additional arguments to pass such as `index`, `unique`, or `default`.
    - specify VARCHAR lenghts on the right, eg. `MyColumn: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(64))` will create a `VARCHAR(64)`
    - JSON should be coded as `Mapped[Dict[str,Any]]`
    - ENUM columns should be defined as Python types. The left hand values should match the desired SQL ENUM. The right hand side is not relevant. To create `ENUM('OCT', 'CF')`:
        ```
        class FeatureModalityEnum(enum.Enum):
            OCT = 1
            CF = 2
        ```
        Then set up the column as: `MyColumn: Mapped[FeatureModalityEnum]`

- To add new relationships, take a look at how they are currently set up in the ORM. For more information refer to the [Relationship docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/basic_relationships.html).
- classmethods starting with `by_` are selectors. For example, `by_id` in the `ImageInstance` class will query the database and return an image object with the given ID.
- classmethods starting with `from_` are alternative constructors. For example, `from_imagesets` in the `Task` class will construct a Task object given lists of image IDs and other arguments needed to define a Task.



# Migrations

We use alembic for managing database migrations. This section explains our processes:

- [Setting up](#setting-up-alembic) for working with migrations
- [Developing migrations](#developing-migrations) 
- [Testing migrations](#testing-migrations)
- [Applying migrations](#applying-migrations-to-the-production-database) 


## **Setting up** Alembic



### 1. Development repository

Make sure eyened_orm in installed (see getting_started)
Alembic is installed with eyened_orm. Make sure the `alembic` command is available in the terminal.

To set up a testing environment, check the README here: https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform/tree/main/orm/migrations


:::note
Alembic reads the ORM objects with `Base.metadata` in `../alembic/env.py`. 
This is used only to generate automatic migrations (see below). 
The code in env.py will look for an `eyened_orm` Python package in the current environment. 
If you installed the ORM as above you should be set up. 
Any changes to the ORM code will be directly accessible to alembic.
:::

### 2. Commiting to production

When committing migrations to production:
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Create a pull request with the migration changes
3. Get code review approval
4. Merge to main branch
5. Deploy the changes following the deployment procedure



## **Developing** migrations

1. Prepare a copy of the production database (see https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform/tree/main/orm/migrations)

2. Change the ORM code to reflect the desired change in database structure. 
See `ORM conventions` above. 
Then move to the alembic folder <strong>eyened-orm/alembic_</strong>

3. Auto-generate alembic migration:

    ```
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "my migration description"
    ```

    This will create a new migration file in `alembic/versions`. 
    Every migration *.py script contains two functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. 
    `upgrade()` is the migration and will apply any changes necessary to make the database match the current state of the ORM.
    It should contain commands that apply your newly made changes to the database. 
    If you auto-generate the migration without making any changes to the ORM (i.e.: when DB and ORM are in sync) the function should be blank (`pass`). 
    The `downgrade()` function contains instructions to undo the migration.


4. Check if `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "test"` leaves a blank migration file. If not, fix discrepancies and generate a new commit.

5. Manually edit the migration functions `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` 
:::caution
**Check carefully**. Especially note that alembic cannot detect changes in table and column names and will instead generate eg. a `drop_column` command followed by an `add_column` command. These should be changed into [alter_column](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/ops.html#alembic.operations.Operations.alter_column) or [rename_table](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/ops.html#alembic.operations.Operations.rename_table). See [here for limitations of alembic auto-generation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html#what-does-autogenerate-detect-and-what-does-it-not-detect). 
:::

6. Once you are satisfied with the migration file, run the migration on the test database:
    ```
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

7. If the migration fails, recreate the test database and then repeat steps 4-6 until the migration is successful.

8. `test_database` and test ORM are now in sync. Now, store the full SQL migration by running:

    ```
    ./export_alembic_sql.sh
    ```
    This script is located in the `orm/alembic_` directory.

9. Push the changes on a branch with a convenient name, that reflects the changes made. 
Submit a pull request. 

## **Testing** migrations

:::note
This documentation overlaps with README:
https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform/tree/main/orm/migrations 
:::

### Environment
The ORM includes a utility to easily create a copy of the production database into a running mysql server, for testing.
For this to work the ORM needs access to the database credentials for both production and test database. 
Add a `source.env` (production) and `test.env` (test) files as explained in [ORM Configuration](/eyened-platform/orm/configuration) 

Set up alembic to work with your testing enviroment:
```
eorm set-connection-string -e test
```
Where 'test' sets up the connection string in alembic based on the variables in `test.env`

### Create test database
Once this is done, you have two options to populate the database:

1. **Limited Data Copy** (Recommended for most development work):
   ```
   eorm test -s source -t test -r root_conditions.json
   ```
   This creates a small test database with only the data specified in `root_conditions.json`. 
   The `-s source` and `-t test` parameters refer to the .env files for source and test databases.

2. **Full Database Copy** (Use when you need the complete production dataset):
   ```
   eorm full -s source -t test
   ```
   This creates a complete copy of the production database.

Both options will:
1. Dump the production database to a temporary file 
2. Drop and re-create the test database
3. Load the dumpfile into the new test database

Note: Despite the command name, neither option runs any tests or applies migrations - they only set up the database state.



### Test the migration:

1. Check out the relevant eyened_orm commit / branch that you wish test in your development repository (or test virtualenv set up for this purpose).
2. Apply the migration on the test database (from the alembic folder):
    ```
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
TODO: or perhaps run this?
    ```
    alembic upgrade head --sql > migration.sql
    ```

This should always succeed. 
If there are issues with running the migration it could be a bug or that other migrations have been applied in between. 
In this case changing the down_revision might be necessary. Be careful!

### What to test

1. Test any code the migration might affect, including at least:
    - Data integrity after migration
    - EyeNED viewer
    - importing images
  

TODO: add unit tests


## **Applying** migrations to the production database

The SQL migration file is located in: <strong>eyened-platform/orm/migrations/migration_output/migration_latest.sql</strong>

TODO: check this


To apply the migration:

1. Navigate to the docker directory (eyened-platform/docker):
```
cd docker
```

2. Execute the migration:
```
docker-compose exec database bash
mysql -u root -p'your_password' < /path/to/migration_latest.sql
```
