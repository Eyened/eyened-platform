Claude query: In configuration.mdx, write documentation for the configuration options in config.sample.py. First show the structure of the database configuration and then make a single table with the rest of the options with columns Option, Required and Description
*/}

## Configuration

The Eyened ORM can be configured in two ways:

1. Using environment variables
2. Using a Python configuration object

A sample configuration file is provided at `config.sample.env` in the root of the eyened-platform repository. Copy this file to `<ENV>.env` in the same folder and modify the settings according to your environment.

### Using Environment Variables

The configuration can be loaded into the ORM as:

```python
from eyened_orm import DBManager
DBManager.init("dev")  # Loads configuration from dev.env
session = DBManager.get_session()
```

### Using Python Configuration

Alternatively, you can provide the configuration directly:

```python
from eyened_orm import DBManager
from eyened_orm.utils.config import EyenedORMConfig, DatabaseSettings

config = EyenedORMConfig(
    database=DatabaseSettings(
        DB_HOST="<HOSTNAME>",
        DB_PORT="<PORT>",
        DB_USER="<USER>",
        DB_PASSWORD="<PASSWORD>",
        DB_NAME="<DATABASE>"
    ),
    images_basepath="/PATH/TO/IMAGES",
    annotations_path="/PATH/TO/ANNOTATIONS",
    ...
)

DBManager.init(config)
```

## Configuration Options

The following table describes all available configuration options. Optional variables should be omitted or commented out if not needed:

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| DB_USER | Yes | Database username |
| DB_PASSWORD | Yes | Database password |
| DB_HOST | Yes | Database host address |
| DB_NAME | Yes | Database name |
| DB_PORT | Yes | Database port number |
| SECRET_KEY | No | Secret key used to generate hashes deterministically for password hashing, anonymisation and obfuscation of file names. Required when using the importer or viewer |
| IMAGES_BASEPATH | No | The folder containing local image data. Required when using the importer or when using the ORM to read/write images |
| ANNOTATIONS_PATH | No | Path to the folder containing annotations. Used by the platform for reading and writing annotations. Required when using the ORM to read/write annotations |
| THUMBNAILS_PATH | No | Folder containing the thumbnail structure. Used by the ORM to read thumbnails and by the importer to write thumbnails on insertion. Required when using the importer or when using the ORM to read/write images |
| CFI_CACHE_PATH | No | Path of a cache for fundus images. Used by the importer to write a preprocessed version of the images. If set, preprocessed CFI images will be written to this path upon insertion |
| DEFAULT_STUDY_DATE | No | Default date for new studies when the importer needs to create new studies without a study date. Defaults to 1970-01-01 |
| IMAGE_SERVER_URL | No | URL of the image server endpoint. Used by the ORM to generate URLs to images as `<IMAGE_SERVER_URL>/<dataset_identifier>` |
| TRASH_PATH | No | Folder to move deleted annotations / form_annotations to when deleted from the ORM. If not set, the annotations will not be moved to a trash folder |
