{/* Claude query: Update the documentation in getting_started.mdx using the sample in import.ipynb. Keep the setup section the same but update the Connecting section and add a section briefly showing how to import and use the database objects.  */}

The ORM allows to interact with the Eyened database for operations such as:
- Updating fields not updateable in the viewer
- Importing and exporting data
- Bulk updates to metadata or corrections

:::note
The Eyened API may provide a more convenient way to interact with the database. Use of the ORM is considered advanced as it provides broader functionality and more direct interaction with database objects.
:::

## Setup

To install the ORM locally as a Python package:

```
git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git 
cd eyened-platform/orm
pip install -e .
```

## Connecting to the database

The easiest way to connect the ORM to a database from Python code, use the `DBManager` class with a configuration:

```python
from eyened_orm import DBManager
# Initialize with environment variables from `orm/eyened_orm/environments/prod.env`
DBManager.init("prod")
# Get a session to interact with the database
session = DBManager.get_session()
```

:::tip
See [ORM Configuration](/eyened-platform/orm/configuration) for more information on how to create environments or manually set up configuration files for the ORM.

## Working with database objects

Once connected, you can import and use database objects from the ORM:

```python
# Import database model classes
from eyened_orm import Project, Patient, Study, Series, Image

# Find a project by name
project = Project.by_name(session, 'My Project Name')

# Access related objects
for patient in project.patients:
    print(f"Patient ID: {patient.patient_id}, Identifier: {patient.patient_identifier}")
    
    for study in patient.studies:
        print(f"  Study date: {study.study_date}")
        
        for series in study.series:
            print(f"    Series ID: {series.series_id}")
            
            for image in series.images:
                print(f"      Image path: {image.path}")

# Query objects directly
patients = session.query(Patient).filter(Patient.patient_identifier.like("Patient_%")).all()
```
