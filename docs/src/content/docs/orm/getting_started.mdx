{/* Claude query: Update the documentation in getting_started.mdx using the sample in import.ipynb. Keep the setup section the same but update the Connecting section and add a section briefly showing how to import and use the database objects.  */}

The ORM allows you to interact with the Eyened database for operations such as:
- Updating fields not updateable in the viewer
- Importing and exporting data
- Bulk updates to metadata or corrections

:::note
The Eyened API may provide a more convenient way to interact with the database. Use of the ORM is considered advanced as it provides broader functionality and more direct interaction with database objects.
:::

## Setup

To install the ORM locally as a Python package:

```
git clone https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform.git 
cd eyened-platform/orm
pip install -e .
```

## Connecting to the database

The easiest way to connect the ORM to a database from Python code is to use the `Database` class with a configuration:

```python
from eyened_orm import Database

# Initialize database
database = Database()

with database.get_session() as session:
    # Use session for database operations
    pass
```

:::tip
See [ORM Configuration](/eyened-platform/orm/configuration) for more information on how to create environments or manually set up configuration files for the ORM.

## Working with database objects

Once connected, you can import and use database objects from the ORM:

```python
# Import database model classes
from eyened_orm import Project, Patient, Study, Series, ImageInstance

# Find a project by name
project = Project.by_name(session, 'My Project Name')

# Access related objects
for patient in project.Patients:
    print(f"Patient ID: {patient.PatientID}, Identifier: {patient.PatientIdentifier}")
    
    for study in patient.Studies:
        print(f"  Study date: {study.StudyDate}")
        
        for series in study.Series:
            print(f"    Series ID: {series.SeriesID}")
            
            for image in series.ImageInstances:
                print(f"      Image path: {image.path}")

# Query objects directly
patients = session.query(Patient).filter(Patient.PatientIdentifier.like("Patient_%")).all()

# You can also use Python-style attribute names
for patient in project.Patients:
    print(f"Patient ID: {patient.patient_id}, Identifier: {patient.patient_identifier}")
    
    for study in patient.Studies:
        print(f"  Study date: {study.study_date}")
```

:::tip
The properties on each ORM object are the same as the database column names (in capitalized camel case), but they're also exposed in Python style (snake_case). For example, you can access `patient_id` instead of `PatientID`, `patient_identifier` instead of `PatientIdentifier`, and `study_date` instead of `StudyDate`.
