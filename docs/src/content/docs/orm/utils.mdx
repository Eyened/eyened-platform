## Thumbnail management

The ORM uses the `ThumbnailPath` column of `ImageInstance` to store thumbnail path and state:

- *NULL* means that the image contains no thumbnail and the thumbnail generation code must be ran on this image. 
- An empty string indicates that the thumbnail generator ran and failed for this image.
- Any other value will be interpreted as a relative path to the image thumbnail within the `THUMBNAILS_PATH` directory.

This section explains how to update thumbnails in the database, potentially after the thumbnail generation code has been updated.

:::note
These steps below assume that the ORM is locally installed and configured as explained in [Getting Started](/eyened-platform/orm/getting_started) and [Configuration](/eyened-platform/orm/configuration).

### Generating thumbnails

The ORM contains a simple `update_thumbnails` script that will create thumbnails:

```
eorm update-thumbnails --env prod
```

This example uses an environment called `prod` to determine what database to connect to and where to write thumbnails. This environment must be provided in a .env file as explained in [/eyened-platform/orm/configuration].

By default, `eorm update-thumbnails` runs only for images with `ThumbnailPath == NULL`. To run also on images with failed thumbnails (useful after the thumbnail generation code has been updated) use:

```
eorm update-thumbnails --failed --env prod
```

### Updating thumbnail generation code

To updated the thumbnail generation code to support new image types or generally change the way thumbnails are generated:



1. Update the [thumbnail generation code](https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform/blob/main/orm/eyened_orm/importer/thumbnails.py). The ORM includes a [notebook](https://github.com/Eyened/eyened-platform/blob/main/orm/notebooks/test_thumbnail_generator.ipynb) to easily visualize the output of these methods on a sample images from the database.
3. For any images that need to be updated in the database, set `ThumbnailPath` to *NULL*.
4. Run the thumbnail update script:

    ```
    eorm update-thumbnails --failed --env prod
    ```
